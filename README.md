Project Abstract:

The legal domain has been slow to adopt and develop machine learning tools and techniques with the cost of collecting and labelling data being a major limiting factor cited.  However, simple tools and techniques applied to niche tasks within a workflow have the potential to drive adoptable improvements.

This project investigates the potential of using unsupervised machine learning techniques to extract insight from legal contracts and demonstrates how this insight could be used to make informed decisions.
Drawing motivation from industry and the challenges faced during the merger of two companies, it investigates if existing manual workflows can be augmented with unsupervised machine learning tools and techniques.

By applying natural language processing techniques combined with specialist legal domain knowledge, it demonstrates that an unseen corpa of contracts can be split in to defined groups, and that meaningful intuition can be given about the nature of the groups in relation to specific clauses.  By automating this task, we argue that a supplier contract review following the merger of two companies could be planned more efficiently.
